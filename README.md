### Retrieving class listings
#### callWebSocAPI(options, callback) {
To retrieve class listings, you just call this function `callWebSocAPI` and pass in two parameters. The first parameter, options, is an object
that configures what you're looking for, such as department, term, division etc. The second parameter is a callback function
that is called when the function is done retrieving classes.
